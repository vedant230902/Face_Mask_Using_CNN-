Face Mask Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

Overview
Face mask detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is a computer vision application aimed at automatically detecting whether a person is wearing a face mask or not. This technology has gained significant importance, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, to enforce mask-wearing policies in various public settings.

1.**Dataset**: The dataset consists of images containing faces with and without masks. These images are labeled accordingly. The dataset may be obtained from various sources, including publicly available datasets or custom data collection efforts.

2.**Preprocessing**: Before training the CNN model, preprocessing steps such as resizing images to a standard size may be applied to improve model performance and generalization.

3.**Model Architecture**: The CNN model architecture typically consists of multiple convolutional layers followed by pooling layers for feature extraction. Additional fully connected layers and output layers are used for classification. The final layer consists of only 2 layers as this is a binary classification problem.

4.**Training**: The CNN model is trained using labeled data, with images of faces as input and corresponding labels indicating whether the face is wearing a mask or not. Training involves optimizing model parameters using backpropagation and gradient descent algorithms.

5.**Testing**: The model can be tested by simply uploading images to the colab document. It will given a conclusion whether the person is wearing a mask or not.
